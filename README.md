# Visualizing colloids, using webgl.

![example](docs/example.png)

An example of cubic paricles in spherical confinement. 

## Introduction ##
Viscol is an online tool to visualize colloidal particles in 3D in a browser. It can be used to view, inspect and manipulate 
3D configurations of particles. Different particles shapes can be displayed such as spheres, cubes and rods and it
is easily extendible to other particle shapes.
